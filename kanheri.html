       A 2,000-year-old complex sits within the park, housing more than 100 (is this correct) caves cut out of rock forming a protected archaeological site. The word ‘Kanheri’ is derived from Sanskrit word ‘Krishnagiri’, which literally means ‘black mountain’. View the magnificent relics of Buddha and the Bodhisattvas and walk along the pillared corridors of the prayer halls. One can drive, walk, take a bus ride or even cycle up to here.
