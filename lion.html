         Make your visit a memorable one as you watch the big cats at the ‘Tiger & Lion Safari’ from the safety and comfort of a closed vehicle. The expansive safari cages enable the visitors to watch these big cats from the safety of a closed vehicle and in a simulated wild landscape. The wildlife interpretation center at the ticket booking counter helps us better understand the different wild animals and their natural habitat better.
